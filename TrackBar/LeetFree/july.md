    5 - Media of two sorted arrays
        > Use binary search on smaller array to find partition position, then find position of partition on larger array. After that check the conditions, 1. MaxXLeft <= MinYRight, 2. MaxYleft <= MinXright. If this is true, we found else, according to value of MaxXleft and MinYright, we will shift our partition pointer in X.
